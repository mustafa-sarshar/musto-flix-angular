## THE 5 Wâ€™s

- Who â€” The users of the [Musto Flix](https://mustafa-sarshar.github.io/musto-flix-angular/welcome) movie app and codebase, including other developers and designers.
- What â€” A single-page, responsive movie app built with Angular, with routing and several interface views. The client-side developed will support the existing server-side [MovieApi](https://github.com/mustafa-sarshar/movie-api) by facilitating user requests and rendering the response from the server-side via a number of different interface views.
- When â€” Users will be able to use the app whenever they want to read information about different movies or update their user information.
- Where â€” The app will be hosted online. It is responsive and can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users an equal experience.
- Why â€” Movie enthusiasts like to be able to access information about different movies, directors, stars, and genres whenever they want. The app will demonstrate my Angular skills and my ability to create straightforward documentation for other developers and employers.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

- Angular +15
- Angular Material Design

## DEVELOPMENT SERVER

- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.1.
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## CODE SCAFFOLDING

- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## BUILD

- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## RUNNING UNIT TESTS

- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## RUNNING END-TO-END TESTS

- Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## FURTHER HELP

- To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
